# Emergency News PWA (ENP)

A simple app that lets you read Reddit posts even when you don't have internet.

## What is this for?

ENP saves Reddit posts on your phone so you can read them later without internet. This is useful for:

- **Emergencies** - Access news and information during disasters when internet is down
- **Remote areas** - Read posts in places with poor signal
- **Saving data** - Load posts once, read them many times without using more data

## How to use it

### Getting started

1. Open the app in your web browser
2. Pick your country from the list to get suggested news sources
3. Or add your own favorite subreddits manually

### Reading posts

- Posts save automatically when you're online
- You can read them anytime, even without internet
- Click "Refresh Posts" when online to get new posts

### Two feeds

- **My Feed** - Shows posts from your chosen subreddits
- **Popular** - Shows what's popular on Reddit right now

Switch between them by tapping the tabs at the top.

### Managing your subreddits

- **Add** - Type a subreddit name and click "Add Subreddit"
- **Remove** - Click the × next to any subreddit in the list
- **Export** - Save your subreddit list as a file (for backup)
- **Import** - Load a previously saved list

## Installing on your phone

1. Open the app in your phone's browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or "Install"
3. Tap it to install the app
4. Now it works like a regular app!

## Tips

- Add subreddits before you might lose internet (before trips, storms, etc.)
- The app saves about 25 posts per subreddit
- Works best on Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browsers
- All your data stays on your phone - nothing is sent anywhere

## Updates

- You'll see an "Update Now" button at the top
- Click it to get the latest version
- Your saved posts and subreddits won't be deleted

## Privacy
